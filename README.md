# Training [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) models in Go

Python is the primary language in which TensorFlow models are typically
developed and trained. TensorFlow does have [bindings for other programming
languages](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/). These bindings have the
low-level primitives that are required to build a more complete API, however,
lack much of the higher-level API richness of the Python bindings, particularly
for defining the model structure.

This file demonstrates taking a model (a TensorFlow graph) created by a Python
program and running the training loop in Go.

## Usage

`docker build . -t tiny_tf`

Runs a single training step, and saves checkpoint. Could be multiple.
`docker run tiny_tf`

## The model

The model is a trivial one, trying to learn the function: `f(x) = W\*x + b`,
where `W` and `b` are model parameters. The training data is constructed so that
the "true" value of `W` is 3 and that of `b` is 2, i.e., `f(x) = 3 * x + 2`.

## Quickstart

1.  Install [TensorFlow for Go](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/go/README.md)
    and [TensorFlow for Python](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)

2.  Create the graph: `python ./model.py`

3.  Execute the training loop in go: `go run train.go`

## Noteworthy

-   The Python APIs for TensorFlow include other conveniences for training (such
    as `MonitoredSession` and `tf.train.Estimator`), which make it easier to
    configure checkpointing, evaluation loops etc. The examples here aren't that
    sophisticated and are focused on basic model training only.
-   In this example, we use placeholders and feed dictionaries to feed input,
    but in a real example you probably want to use the
    [`tf.data`](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/datasets) API to
    cconstruct an input pipeline for providing training data to the model.
-   Not demonstrated here, but summaries for TensorBoard can also be produced by
    executing the summary operations.
